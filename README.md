# Java-Mud
This is for making a mulit-user dungeon with Java
2/21/22 we are using the Scanner class in order to read in a map.txt file to build the map for our dungeon. 
There are also Room, Player, and Exit classes to facilitate any actions needed to do. 

Currently working on making the player move.
